# object_concepts.yaml
# 
# Maps detected objects (COCO classes) to musical context concepts.
# This is a CURATED database - unmapped classes are ignored.
#
# Schema per entry:
#   scale:  intimate | room | hall | vast | cosmic | null
#   origin: organic | natural | hybrid | mechanical | synthetic | null
#   energy: still | breathing | flowing | rhythmic | churning | null
#   weight: 0.5–1.5 (importance multiplier, default 1.0)
#
# Guidelines:
#   - null means "no opinion on this axis" (won't influence it)
#   - weight > 1.0 for strongly evocative objects
#   - weight < 1.0 for ambiguous or background objects
#   - Think: "If this object dominates the image, what mood?"
