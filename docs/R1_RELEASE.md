## 1. Product Positioning

**Noise Engine = 8-layer texture instrument with playability layer**

Not competing with Pigments/Vital/Phase Plant. The best generative texture rack with deep modulation, safety, and pack workflow.

## 4a. Polish (Pre Go-Live)

Not blocking R1 but should address before public release:

| Item | Effort |
|------|--------|
| UI font audit | 1 hr |
| Empty mod state polish | 30 min |

---

## 5. Explicitly Out of Scope (R1)

### Deferred to R1.1

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Preset expansion (Phase 2-4) | Current save/load works |
| Velocity/AT/pitchbend as mod sources | Enhancement, not broken |
| Unified param addressing | Architecture cleanup |
| Cross-platform testing | Need testers first |
| MIDI Learn | Power user feature |

### Deferred Indefinitely

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| SC reconnect lifecycle | Restart app acceptable |
| CPU meter | SC handles externally |
| Undo/Redo | Massive scope |
| Error console panel | Terminal acceptable |
| Audio I/O settings | SC handles externally |

### Never (Architecture Decisions)

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Sampler/buffer generator | Scope creep, not this synth |
| Per-slot FX | Master chain is the design |
| Pseudo-poly allocator | 8-slot texture rack, not polysynth |
| New filter characters (ladder/MS-20/SEM) | Current filter works |
| Sequencer (note or parameter) | Deliberate design choice. External MIDI/DAW for sequencing. Texture instrument with clock-synced envelopes + modulation. |

| Generator | 6 | 6 | 100% |
| Modulation | 3 | 3 | 100% |
| Performance | 2 | 2 | 100% |
| Mixer | 3 | 3 | 100% |

| **Total** | **24.5** | **35** | **70%** |

### By Category

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Core functionality** | 🟢 **100%** (All layers complete!) |
| **R1 feature gaps** | 🟢 **100%** (All features done!) |
| **Content** | ~40% (core done, packs needed) |
| **Documentation** | ~10% (Windows guide exists) |
| **Release gates** | 0% (not started) |

### Remaining Work

| Item | Effort | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| CQD_Forge packs | 3-4 sessions | High — no content = no release |
| Documentation | 1 session | Medium — onboarding |
| Release gates | 0.5 session | Final — ship prep |

---

## 11. Focus Recommendation

**Next session priority:**

1. **CQD_Forge packs** — Critical path blocker, 3-4 sessions
2. **Documentation** — Can parallelize with pack creation
3. **Release gates** — Final prep before ship

**All feature gaps closed!** Only content, docs, and release gates remain.

**Don't start until packs are done:**
- Release gates (LICENSE, CHANGELOG, index.html, tag)
- Polish items
