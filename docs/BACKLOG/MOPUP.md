# Mopup (Small Tasks)

Quick fixes — just do it, no spec needed.

- [ ] UI font audit — improve visibility across all labels
- [ ] Empty mod state polish
- [ ] CWD-independent path resolution — remove `tests/conftest.py` chdir workaround
- [ ] Generator type button width (too narrow for pack-prefixed names, ~120-140px needed)
